    //        mix-up with the `event` argument from event handlers.
    dispatch({ event: "SUBMIT" });
  };

  // 6Ô∏è‚É£ According to the state chart, once a machine enters "loading quiz" state
  //   a request to get questions should be triggered. Data fetching is a
  //   side-effect that should be handled inside `React.useEffect()` hook.
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (state.status === STATUSES.LOADING) {
      // @TODO: Consider displaying only 2 questions at a time to make testing
      //        for the successful state easier.

    // Here is the logic to be implemented:
    //    1. If the status has changed to "LOADING", call the `fetchQuestions`
    //       function that triggers a request.
    //    ‚ùóÔ∏è `fetchQuestions` is asynchronous and should be used with Promise or
    //       async/await syntax.
    //    üí° You can find data returned from `fetchQuestions` sample in
    //       "./dataSample.json".
    //    2. Questions should be saved in a state. You have 2 options where to
    //       store them:
    //       - inside component state (with `useState`)
    //       - inside reducer state (alongside `status`)
    //    üí° To keep component clean from the logic, I would recommend to store
    //       all kind of data inside reducer state. In order to do this:
    //        - go back to `./reducer.js` file and add `questions: []` to the
    //         `initialState`,
    //        - dispatch "Request succeed" action that contains `event` and
    //         `questions`.
    //          Eg.: dispatch({ event: "LOAD", questions: data.results });
  }, [state.status]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // 9Ô∏è‚É£ Part 1. Once "Get results" button is clicked the machine should enter
    //    the "Loading results" state. In that case, check for the correctness
    //    of the answers and transition to the next state based on the result.
    //    Here is what you need to do:
    //    1. Add an "if" statement to check for "Loading results" state.
    //    2. Check for the correctness of the answers using the following lines
    //       of code:
    //       const answers = serialize(formRef.current, { hash: true });
    //       const isCorrect = getIsResultCorrect(state.questions, answers);
    //    3. Transition to the next state using `dispatch`.
    if (state.status === STATUSES.VALIDATION) {
      const answers = serialize(formRef.current, { hash: true });
      const isCorrect = getIsResultCorrect(state.questions, answers);
